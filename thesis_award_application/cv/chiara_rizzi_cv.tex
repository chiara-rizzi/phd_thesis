\section{Research Experience}
During my bachelor, master and PhD studies I had the opportunity to carry out my research in the ATLAS Collaboration and, in the context of a summer student program, I also worked in the CDF Experiment. 
For my bachelor thesis and at CDF I worked on analyses in the framework of top quark physics, while during my master thesis and PhD the main focus of my research has been on R-parity-conserving (RPC) Supersymmetry (SUSY) searches. SUSY, one of the most promising extensions of the Standard Model (SM), predicts the existence of superpartners for all the SM particles; in the RPC minimal supersymmetric standard model SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. In parallel during the PhD I have also contributed to the TileCal luminosity group, to the b-tagging calibration effort, and to the development of a tool designed to overcome the low statistics of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in events with high b-jets multiplicity. Below I detail the main activities where I have been involved and my contributions, starting from the most recent ones.

\par\medskip

\cvline{\textbf{TileCal} 2017-present}{The ATLAS hadronic tile calorimeter (TileCal) is one of the ATLAS sub-systems sensitive to the value of instantaneous luminosity: a higher luminosity corresponds to a higher particle flux, which in turn leads to a higher current drawn by the photomultiplier tubes (PMT). I am currently studying how the PMT response depends on the peak luminosity, and how this impacts the TileCal luminosity determination.}

\cvline{\textbf{Higgsinos} 2016-present}{In natural SUSY models, where SUSY solves the fine-tuning in the Higgs mass determination, the SUSY particles that give relevant corrections to the Higgs mass are required to be light. These are the partners of the Higgs boson (higgsinos), the top (stops) and the gluons (gluinos). I have performed a search targeting higgsino pair production, where each higgsino decays into Higgs boson and gravitino, the SUSY partner of the graviton, that escapes undetected. The Higgs boson decays into $b\overline{b}$ pair with 58\% branching ratio, so a search for final states with 4 b-jets and missing transverse momentum ($E_\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}$) is very sensitive to this scenario. The dominant background is top quark pair production in association with heavy flavour quarks. In this search, where I have been analysis contact, I have worked on the channel targeting signals with high masses; I have defined the analysis strategy, optimized the analysis regions to maximize the sensitivity, verified the background modelling and performed the statistical analysis.
%During my PhD I have actively contributed to two SUSY searches, targeting two different natural SUSY models, both leading to a final state with multiple b-jets and missing transverse momentum (MET). \newline 
}

\cvline{\textbf{Gluinos} 2015-present}{
A major activity that I have carried out since the beginning of my PhD has been a search for gluino pair production, with a decay chain involving four top or bottom quarks and the LSP, leading to a final state with four b-jets, $E_\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and a variable number of leptons depending on the top quarks decay. Also in this search, top quark pair production in association with heavy flavour jets constitutes the dominant background. I have been strongly involved in all the iterations of this analysis, that during the LHC Run2 has produced two papers and several conference notes. In the different iterations I have worked on various aspects of the analysis, from analysis optimization and extensive studies of the modelling of the background, to the final statistical analysis and limit setting, and I am now analysis contact.}

\cvline{\textbf{b-tagging} 2014-2017}{Low MC statistics is often a limitation in analyses selecting events with high b-jets multiplicity. This problem can be overcome if, instead of selecting only the MC events with many b-jets, all the events are kept and weighted by the probability that each event contains a certain number of b-tagged jets (truth tagging). I have developed and validated a tool to easily apply this method, which is now used in several analyses.\newline
I have also joined the b-tagging calibration group, by contributing to the effort toward a data-based calibration of the b-tagging algorithms for high-p$_\mathrm{T}$ jets. This study aims at using the distribution of the impact parameter significance of the tracks inside the jets to measure in data the different flavour fractions before and after applying the b-tagging algorithm, allowing therefore to measure the algorithm efficiency on data and compare it with the efficiency from MC simulation. }

\cvline{\textbf{Stop, stau} 2013-2014}{During my master thesis I have analyzed the data collected in 2012 by the ATLAS Experiment, selecting events with one hadronically and one leptonically decaying tau candidates, b-jets and missing momentum to search for direct  production of stop pairs, decaying via a scalar tau (stau) to a gravitino. I have carried out most of the steps of the analysis, focusing in particular on the analysis optimization and on the modelling of the major backgrounds: top quark pairs and W bosons in association with jets.}

\cvline{\textbf{Top Di-Tau}\newline 2013}{As a summer student I have contributed to a CDF analysis measuring the top pair production cross section and the top decay branching fraction into tau lepton, tau neutrino and bottom quark, and placing limits on the branching fraction of the top quark into charged Higgs. When I joined the analysis team the analysis was already structured, and my contribution has been revising and performing the statistical interpretation and producing the material for the paper.}
