\section{Pre-fit data-MC}
\label{sec:strong:dataMC}
In this section we show the pre-fit agreement between data and the \gls{mc} simulation before the fit in the \gls{cr}
in the distribution of the same kinematic variables as in Section \ref{sec:strong:sigbkg}. 
All the plots show in this section do not include systematic uncertainties and include all the relevant \gls{mc} \glspl{sf}. 
In order to investigate a region of the phase space depleted in signal events the requirement on the number
of b-tagged jets is relaxed to $\nbjet \geq 3$.
