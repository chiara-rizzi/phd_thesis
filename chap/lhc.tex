\label{chap:cern}

The analyses presented in this thesis use the \gls{pp} collision data at a center-of-mass energy \cmtre TeV 
collected by the \gls{atlas} experiment in 2015, 2016 and 2017. 

The \gls{atlas} experiment is one of the four main experiments at the \gls{lhc} at the \gls{cern}. Section \ref{sed:cern:lhc} of this chapter describes the \gls{lhc} accelerator complex. This is followed by a general description of the detectors used in high-energy physics in Section \ref{sec:detectors}. The \gls{atlas} detector is discussed in Section \ref{sed:cern:atlas}.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sed:cern:lhc}

In this section we give a brief introduction to the \gls{lhc} \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001}, at the moment the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, hosted by \gls{cern} and in operation since September 2008.


\subsection{A circular hadron collider}

The \gls{lhc} is a circular hadron accelerator, located in a 26.7-km-long underground tunnel (with a depth ranging between 50 and 140 meters) that was previously hosting the \gls{lep}, a \gls{cern} accelerator that was operational from 1989 to 2000. The \gls{lhc} can accelerate protons up to a design center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Accelerating particles to very high energies is necessary both to study the structure of the particles themselves at smaller scales, and to create heavy states in collisions. Cosmic rays provide a source of particles with energies up to $10^7$ times more than what the \gls{lhc} is capable of, but these extremely energetic rays are very rare, and the flux is not controlled. Accelerators provide a well controlled flux of particles of a specific type in a specific location, and this allows the study of these particles with dedicated detectors.

A circular accelerator simplifies the acceleration of particles, as this can happen over several revolutions. When a charged particle travels on an orbit of radius $r$ under the effect of a magnetic field $B$, its momentum $p$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:p03br}
p = 0.3 r B,
\end{equation}
\noindent where the momentum is expressed in GeV, B in Tesla and the radius of the orbit in meters. For a given magnetic field, a larger radius allows to reach higher energies. 

The choice of a collider over a fixed-target experiment is motivated by the possibility of reaching a higher energy in center-of-mass of the system: while in a fixed-target experiment this is proportional to the square root of the energy of the incoming particle, in a collider it is the sum of the energies of the two beams.


Suitable particles for a collider experiment need to fulfill two criteria: they need to be charged, in order to be accelerated and guided through electric and magnetic fields, and they need to be stable enough not to decay before being used for collisions. These criteria effectively limit the choice to protons, electrons, their antiparticles and ions. 

At the \gls{lhc} it has been chosen to study collisions with protons and lead ions. Three types of collisions are studied: proton-proton ($p-p$), lead-lead ($Pb-Pb$) and also proton-lead ($Pb-p$). The main reason to prefer protons over electrons is the energy loss that affects charged particles accelerated in a circular trajectory (\textit{syncrotron radiation}), which decreases with the fourth power of the mass of the particle:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:sync}
\frac{dE}{dt} \propto \frac{E^4}{m^4 r^2} \; .
\end{equation}

The larger mass of a proton with respect to an electron leads to a decrease by a factor $10^{12}$ in the energy lost through syncrotron radiation. This choice comes with a price: proton-proton collisions lead to less clean events, with a lot of soft interactions covering the interesting hard interactions. Furthermore, the center-of-mass energy is unknown as the particles taking part in hard interactions are not the protons themselves but their constituents.

\subsection{Magnet system} 


The \gls{lhc} is not a perfect circumference: it is composed of eight arcs (\textit{sectors}), where the magnetic system is located, and eight straight sections containing the resonant cavities, the four interaction points with and the detectors, the equipment for beam injection and extraction, and other instrumentation. Magnetic fields are used to govern the trajectory of the particles. In the \gls{lhc} there are more than nine thousand magnets, constructed from a superconducting alloy of niobium and titanium. About 150 tons of super-fluid helium at a temperature of 1.9 K are used to maintain the magnet system in the superconducting regime. Different types of magnets are necessary to achieve a proper control over the trajectory of the particles.

\subsubsection*{Dipoles} 
Dipoles are used to create a vertical magnetic field, so as to bend the particles in the horizontal plane and thus give the dominant circular orbit. The \gls{lhc} has 1232 dipoles, each 15 m long and providing a magnetic field of 8.3 T. The current necessary to achieve this strong magnetic field is 11.8 kA.


\subsubsection*{Quadrupoles}
The \gls{lhc} has 858 quadrupoles, used for beam focusing. A single quadrupole can focus the beam either in the vertical or the horizontal plane, but it causes a defocusing in the other plane; conventionally a quadrupole is denoted as focusing if it is oriented to focus in the horizontal plane. A combination of focusing and defocusing quadrupoles separated by some drift space (\textit{FODO lattice}) is used to keep both planes focused, and gives rise to \textit{Betatron oscillations}. Figure \ref{fig:lhc:quad} shows a schematic representation of the transverse view of a quadrupole magnet.

\subsubsection*{Higher-order magnets} 
Beside dipoles and quadrupoles, in the \gls{lhc} there are about 600 higher-order magnets that are used to maintain a good beam quality; e.g.  sextupoles are used to correct the spread in Betatron tune caused by the quadrupoles.

\label{fig:lhc:quad}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Resonant cavities}

While the orbit of particles is governed by the magnetic fields, longitudinal electric fields are used for acceleration. In the \gls{lhc} the electric filed is provided by \gls{rf} cavities. There are overall 16 \gls{rf} cavities, eight per beam, hosted in four cryo-modules. Each cavity can provide an accelerating field of 5 MV/m, and oscillates with a frequency of 400 MHz. Since the electric field changes over time with the oscillations, particles passing through the same point of a \gls{rf} cavity at different times experience a different voltage; this produces a non-trivial longitudinal dynamics, where particles oscillate around the ideal synchronous particle with changes in momentum and phase (\textit{Synchrotron oscillations}). If we define the \textit{slip factor} $\eta$ as the relative change in frequency in Synchrotron oscillations with the relative change in momentum:
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{\Delta f / f}{\Delta p / p} \; ,
\end{equation}

\noindent and the compaction factor $\alpha$ as the relative change in frequency in orbit length with the relative change in momentum:

\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{\Delta L / L}{\Delta p / p} \; ,
\end{equation}

\noindent the following relation holds:

\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{1}{\gamma^2} - \alpha \; ,
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the particle. This means that while the energy of the particle is low ($\eta>0$) an increase in momentum leads to an increase in frequency, while it leads to a decrease in frequency for $\eta<0$. At the transition energy, a previously stable synchrotron phase becomes unstable and vice versa; this requires a rapid change in \gls{rf} phase. This situation is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:lhc:phase}(a). For example, a particle corresponding to the phase point M1 will arrive in the \gls{rf} cavity after one corresponding to the stability point P1, and will experiment higher voltage and increase in momentum; if $\eta>0$ this increase in momentum will translate in an increase in frequency and the particle will, at the following revolution, arrive earlier, while if $\eta<0$ the frequency will further decrease and the particle will be eventually lost.  The transition energy in the \gls{lhc} is 53 GeV, well below the injection energy of 450 GeV, so the \gls{lhc} is always above transition.

\label{fig:lhc:phase}
\end{figure}


In the \gls{lhc} beams particles are not distributed continuously, as this would now be allowed by phase instabilities, but are divided in \textit{bunches}. 
The areas of stable motion are identified as \textit{bucket}, and the area of the bucket is the beam \textit{longitudinal acceptance}. The beam bunches fill only a part of the bucket, and the area of the beam bunches is the \textit{longitudinal beam emittance}. Figure \ref{fig:lhc:phase}(b) shows a schematic view of the bucket and the bunch area for the case of a beam above the transition energy. 

\subsection{Luminosity and operational parameters}

The amount of data delivered by an accelerator is quantified by the \textit{integrated luminosity} $\mathcal{L}_{int}$.
Given a certain process with production cross section $\sigma$, the total number of events for that process is the product of cross section and integrated luminosity:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:nev}
N_{\mathrm{events}} = \sigma \,\, \mathcal{L}_{int} \; .
\end{equation}

The integrated luminosity is the time integral of the \textit{instantaneous luminosity} $\mathcal{L}$, 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:intlumi}
\mathcal{L}_{int} = \int \mathcal{L} \, dt \; ,
\end{equation}

\noindent which, assuming a Gaussian particle distribution and the same characteristics for the two beams, can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\frac{f N_b n^2}{4 \pi \sigma_{x}\sigma_{y} } \; ,
\label{eq:cern:lumi}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f$ is the revolution frequency, $N_b$ the number of bunches in each beam, $n$ the number of protons in each bunch and $\sigma_{x(y)}$  is the transverse beam size at the interaction point in the $x$($y$) direction . 

The instantaneous luminosity defined in Eq. \ref{eq:cern:lumi} needs to be corrected for two effects. First of all, this formula assumes a head-on collision between the bunches; in reality, to avoid unwanted interactions the beams collide with a crossing angle, and a large crossing angle decreases the instantaneous luminosity. The second correction is related to the beam transverse size, that can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{x,y} = \sqrt{  \epsilon \beta^* } \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the beam emittance and $\beta^*$ is the \textit{beta function}. Beam collisions happen in \textit{minibeta insertions}, drift spaces with a beta waist in the center, where the beam size is as small as possible. In the vicinity of the minimum, the beta function evolves like:

\begin{equation}
\beta(s) = \beta^* + \frac{s^2}{\beta^*} \; .
\end{equation}

From this it is possible to see that the smaller the beta function, the larger the dependence with $s$, so a bunch with a finite size will not have the same beta function as a whole (\textit{hour glass effect}). This correction becomes more important with the decrease of the $\beta^*$ value. With the \gls{lhc} design parameters, the effect of crossing angle and hour glass changes the instantaneous luminosity by about 20\%.

The main limitations in the choice of the parameters that regulate the luminosity are \textit{collective effects}, which could cause beam instabilities if the number of bunches or the number of protons per bunch is too high, and the limitations in the available aperture in the minbeta quadrupoles, that impacts $\beta^*$. The summary of the \gls{lhc} operational parameters during Run 2 is reported in Table \ref{tab:lhc:param}.

\end{table}


The luminosity profile changes over time, and different experiments have different luminosity needs. \gls{atlas} and CMS profit from having the maximum luminosity possible, while LHCb and ALICE have their top functionality at lower luminosity, and therefore apply a \textit{luminosity leveling} that consists in changing the offset of the beams during the run, to maintain a constant (low) value of the instantaneous luminosity.

A high number of particles participating in a single bunch crossing can lead to a large number of multiple proton-proton collisions (\textit{pileup}). In 2012 the \gls{lhc} operated with a bunch spacing of 50 ns, leading to a pileup of about 35 events per bunch crossing. With the increase in energy from Run 1 to Run 2, the same settings would have implied more than 100 events, above the limit for the proper functioning of the detectors. This is what motivated the choice to move from the 50 ns bunch spacing used in Run 1 to the 25 ns in Run 2: with this setup, for the same instantaneous luminosity is possible to have a lower "luminosity per bunch" and therefore a lower pile up. Figure \ref{fig:atlas:pu} shows the luminosity-weighted distribution of the mean number of interactions per crossing during 2015-2017 as recorded by the \gls{atlas} experiment.

The mean number of interactions per crossing $\mu$ corresponds to the mean of the Poisson distribution of the number of interactions per crossing calculated for each bunch. It is calculated from the instantaneous per-bunch luminosity as 
$\mu = \frac{\mathcal{L}_{bunch}\times \sigma_{inel}}{f}$, where $\mathcal{L}_{bunch}$ is the per-bunch instantaneous luminosity, $\sigma_{inel}$ is the inelastic cross section which is taken to be 80 mb for 13 TeV collisions, and $f$ is the \gls{lhc} revolution frequency.

\subsection{Accelerator complex}

Protons are injected in the \gls{lhc} only after being accelerated to 450 GeV by a sequence of machines.

\begin{itemize}
\item Protons are extracted from a $H_2$ at the \textit{Linac2} facility, a linear accelerator of 33 m that brings them to the energy of 50 MeV.
\item The \gls{psb} is the first synchrotron in the acceleration chain (with a circumference of 157 m), that in 1.2 s increases the energy of the protons from 50 MeV to 1.4 GeV.
\item With a circumference of 628 m, the \gls{ps} brings the protons to about 26 GeV. This was the oldest synchrotron experiment at \gls{cern}.
\item The \gls{sps} is the first accelerator of the chain to be underground (about 30 m) and has a circumference of 6.9 km; it brings the proton energy at 450 GeV. Beside preparing the protons to be injected into the \gls{lhc}, the \gls{sps} provides beam also to the North Area, and to the AWAKE experiment, that studies proton-induced plasma wakefield acceleration.
\item The \gls{lhc} is the last step of this chain, and it accelerates the protons form 450 GeV to 6.5 TeV (the design energy is 7 TeV); while in the \gls{lhc} the protons gain about 0.5 MeV per turn, so it takes about 15 minutes to reach 6.5 TeV.
\end{itemize}

The accelerator complex of \gls{cern} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lhc:acc}. The acceleration chain for lead ions is the same, except that the extraction and first acceleration is performed by \textit{Linac3} instead than by Linac2.

\subsection{Experiments at the LHC}

Seven experiments are built along the \gls{lhc} circumference and collect the data produced during the collisions. Each experiment is run by an independent collaboration that comprises several universities and research institutes. 
\textit{\gls{atlas}} \cite{atlas:atlas} and \textit{CMS} \cite{cms:cms} are the two largest and general purpose experiments, located at two opposite sides of the \gls{lhc} ring, in correspondence with two of the four interaction points. Their goal is to study a large variety of SM processes and to perform an extensive search program for \gls{bsm} physics. The independent design of the two detectors, as well as of the separation between the two collaborations running them, is essential to provide a validation of the \gls{lhc} results. Since the data used in this thesis is collected with the \gls{atlas} detector, a more extensive description of this experiment is given in Section \ref{sed:cern:atlas}. 
The \textit{LHCb} \cite{lhcb:lhcb} and \textit{ALICE} \cite{alice:alice} experiments are located at the other two \gls{lhc} interaction points. LHCb is a single-arm forward spectrometer, designed to perform high-precision studies of heavy flavour physics. The ALICE experiment is dedicated to the study of $Pb-Pb$ collisions, which at the \gls{lhc} happen with a center-of-mass energy of 2.6 TeV per nucleon pair; in this energy regime, quarks and gluons are expected to form a quark-gluon plasma.
The position of the four main experiments on the \gls{lhc} ring is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lhc:acc}.
Other three smaller experiments are installed along the \gls{lhc} circumference: TOTEM \cite{totem:totem}, LHCf \cite{lhcf:lhcf} and MoEDAL \cite{moedal:moedal}. TOTEM is located at the same interaction point as CMS, and measures the total $p-p$ cross section, as well as elastic and inelastic scattering. LHCf is installed in the same interaction point as \gls{atlas} and has two detectors, at 140 m from each side of the collision point, aiming at the study of particles produced in the "forward" region (very close to the beam axis). MoEDAL is installed in the LHCb cavern and is designed to search for magnetic monopoles.
