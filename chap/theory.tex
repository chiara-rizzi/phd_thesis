\chapter{Standard Model and Supersymmetry}
\label{chap:SMSUSY}

This chapter presents an introduction to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, the theory that nowadays best described the subatomic world. In Section \ref{sec:smsusy:sm} a general overview of the SM is given. Section \ref{sec:smsusy:bsm} discusses the limitations of the SM, and some of the theoretical extensions proposed to overcome them. Finally Section \ref{sec:smsusy:susy} focuses on Supersymmetry (SUSY), one of the most promising of these extensions. Throughout this Chapter (as well as in the rest of this thesis) we use Natural units; we will thus use energy units to describe masses, as the speed of light ($c$) and the Plank constant ($\hslash$) are set to unity.


\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{sec:smsusy:sm}

The Standard Model (SM) is a renormalizable gauge quantum field theory based on the group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$. It has been developed in the second half of the 20th century \cite{Glashow:1961tr}\cite{Weinberg:1967tq}\cite{Salam:1980jd}, and since then the description that it gives of the elementary particles and of their interactions has been accurately tested by several experiments. Many experimental discoveries have been guided by the SM predictions, including the discovery of the top quark \cite{Abachi:1994td}\cite{PhysRevLett.74.2626} and up to the latest one, the observation of the Higgs boson at the LHC in July 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa}\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj}.
