\chapter{Standard Model and Supersymmetry}
\label{chap:SMSUSY}

This chapter presents an introduction to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, the theory that nowadays best described the subatomic world. In Section \ref{sec:smsusy:sm} a general overview of the SM is given. Section \ref{sec:smsusy:bsm} discusses the limitations of the SM, and some of the theoretical extensions proposed to overcome them. Finally Section \ref{sec:smsusy:susy} focuses on Supersymmetry (SUSY), one of the most promising of these extensions. Throughout this Chapter (as well as in the rest of this thesis) we use Natural units; we will thus use energy units to describe masses, as the speed of light ($c$) and the Plank constant ($\hslash$) are set to unity.


\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{sec:smsusy:sm}

The Standard Model (SM) is a renormalizable gauge quantum field theory based on the group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$. It has been developed in the second half of the 20th century \cite{Glashow:1961tr}\cite{Weinberg:1967tq}\cite{Salam:1980jd}, and since then the description that it gives of the elementary particles and of their interactions has been accurately tested by several experiments. Many experimental discoveries have been guided by the SM predictions, including the discovery of the top quark \cite{Abachi:1994td}\cite{PhysRevLett.74.2626} and up to the latest one, the observation of the Higgs boson at the LHC in July 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa}\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj}. 

\subsection{Particle Content of the Standard Model}

In the SM, particles are described as fields excitations. In the following sections, we introduce the quantum filed theory descriptions of fermions and bosons.

\subsubsection{Fermions}

Matter constituents are half-integer spin fields (\textit{fermions}). Fermions are further divided into two categories based on the type of interaction they experience:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Leptons} experience only the electroweak interaction
\item \textit{Quarks} experience both the electroweak and the strong interaction
\end{itemize}

Both leptons and quarks come in three generations, and conventionally the numbering of these generations follows an order of increasing mass. While it is possible to observe free leptons, quarks exist only in bound states (\textit{hadrons}); this is because of confinement, discussed in Section \ref{sec:strong}. Hadrons built of three quarks have spin $\frac{1}{2}$ and are named \textit{barions}, while \textit{mesons} are formed by two quarks and have integer spin.


The free lagrangian of a fermion is given by:

\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{L}_{free} = \bar{\psi} \left( i \gamma^{\mu} \partial_{\mu} - m \right) \psi \, , \
 \label{eq:sm:dirac}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\psi$ is the fermion field, $m$ its mass, $\gamma$ are the Dirac matrices and $\partial_{\mu}$ is the four-momentum derivative.


\subsubsection{Bosons}

Particles with integer spin are referred to as \textit{bosons}. In the SM, force carriers are described through spin-1 fields. 
The SM includes also a spin-0 particle, the Higgs boson. Is the interaction with the Higgs boson field that allows all the other elementary particles to acquire mass, as described in Section \ref{sec:smsusy:ew}.

The Klein-Gordon Lagrangian governs the kinenatic of spin-0 neutral particles:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{free} = \frac{1}{2} \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi + \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi ^2 ,
\end{equation}

 
\noindent while in the case of charged particles (described through a complex filed) the Lagrangian becomes:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{free} =  \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi^* +  m^2 \phi \phi^* .
\end{equation}


\noindent The two equations above describe scalar particles. In the case of a vector filed, the expression of the Lagrangian is the following: 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{free} =  - \frac{1}{4} F^{\mu \nu}F_{\mu \nu} +  \frac{1}{2} m^2 A^\mu A_\mu \, .
\label{eq:lproca}
\end{equation}

\noindent This is the Proca Lagrangian. In the case of a particle with zero mass, this reduces to the Maxwell Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{free} =  - \frac{1}{4} F^{\mu \nu}F_{\mu \nu} ,
\label{eq:lmax}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $F^{\mu \nu} = \partial^\mu A_\nu - \partial^\nu A_\mu$.

\subsection{Interactions}

The SM describes all the interactions among elementary particles, except for gravity, for which nowadays no renormalizable quantum field theory is formulated. Table \ref{tab:sm_interazioni} presents a summary of the SM interactions and the properties of the corresponding force carriers. More details about the strong and electroweak sectors are given in the following sections.

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Gauge Invariance}

The interaction terms in the SM Lagrangian are introduced by promoting an already existing global symmetry of the Lagrangian ($\theta$) to a \textit{local} one ($\theta(x)$) function of the space-time coordinates. 
In general, given a Lagrangian globally invariant under a symmetry group, the fields transform as:
\begin{equation}
\psi \rightarrow e^{ig\theta_k \tau_k} \psi  
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\tau_k$ are the generators of the group and obey commutation relations: 
\begin{equation}
\left[ \tau_i, \tau_j \right] = i f_{ijk} \tau^k \, . \
\end{equation}

\noindent $f_{ijk}$ is the structure constant of the group and is always zero for Abelian groups. Promoting this invariance to a global one ($\theta_k \rightarrow \theta_k(x)$) implies adding to the theory:
\begin{itemize}
\item A number of massless gauge fields $W^\mu_k$ equal to the number of generators of the symmetry group, that transform as 
\begin{equation}
W^\mu_k \rightarrow W^\mu_k - \partial^\mu \theta_k - g \epsilon_{klm} \theta^m W^\mu_m 
\end{equation}
\item A covariant derivatibe: 
\begin{equation}
D^\mu = \partial^\mu + ig\tau^kW^\mu_k 
\end{equation}

\noindent that substitutes the standard derivative in the Lagrangian
\item A free Lagrangian for the vector fields as in Eq. \ref{eq:lproca}, with:
\begin{equation}
F^{\mu \nu}_k = \partial_\mu W_k^\nu - \partial_\nu W_k^\mu - g f_k^{lm} W^\mu_l W^\nu_m
\end{equation}
\noindent The last term, of second order in the field, is present only for non-Albelian symmetry groups. 
\end{itemize}


The SM is a theory invariant under $SU(3)_\mathrm{C} \times SU(2)_\mathrm{L} \times U(1)_\mathrm{Y}$. Imposing local invariance under $SU(3)_\mathrm{C}$ leads to the theory of strong interactions, while $SU(2)_\mathrm{L} \times U(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ is the symmetry whose breaking gives origin to the electroweak interactions. 

\subsubsection{Strong Interaction}
\label{sec:strong}

Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) is the theory that describes strong interactions, and it is invariant under the symmetry group $SU(3)_\mathrm{C}$, where the subscript C refers to the color, the quantum number associated with these interactions; this can assume three possible values denoted with red, blue and green. The observable states (hadrons) are color singlets, while quarks (anti-quarks) carry only one color (anti-colr) charge. Since the symmetry group is non-Abelian, also the corresponding eight gauge bosons (\textit{gluons}) carry a color charge (bi-color, with one color and one different anti-color) and therefore interact not only with quarks but also among themselves. Since $SU(3)_\mathrm{C}$ is believed to be an exact symmetry,  gluons are massless. 

The renormalization of a gauge theory leads to the definition of \textit{running coupling constants}, whose value depend on the energy scale where they are evaluated. In QCD, at leading order the dependence of the coupling constant from the energy scale is given by:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_\mathrm{s}(Q^2)=\frac{1}{b\log{\frac{Q^2}{\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}^2}}} \quad \quad b = \frac{11N_\mathrm{C}-2n_\mathrm{f}}{12\pi}
\label{eq:alfaQCD}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N_\mathrm{C}$ is the number of colors, $n_\mathrm{f}$ is the number of quark flavors that are active (i.e. whose mass is lower than the energy scale) and $\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$ is the infrared cutoff scale that sets the limit of validity of the perturbative approximation. In QCD $N_\mathrm{C} = 3$, so for $n_\mathrm{f}<16$ the coupling constants decreases with the increase of the energy scale of the process considered. This structure has important consequences on the properties of quarks and gluons:

\begin{itemize}
\item At high $Q^2$ ($\rightarrow$ small distances), $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$ becomes small enough for the perturbative approximation to be correct. In this case quarks and gluons behave as free particles (\textit{asymptotic freedom}) \cite{PhysRevLett.30.1343}\cite{PhysRevLett.30.1346}.
\item When the momentum transfer is small ($\rightarrow$ large distances) $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$ is large; this gives rise to \textit{confinement}: quarks can not be observed as isolated particles, as it is not possible to extract individual quarks from hadrons. When the distance between two quarks is increased, the potential energy increases as well, up to the point when is energetically more favorable to create from the vacuum a quark-antiquark pair and thus a new hadron is formed.
\item In a collider experiment, quarks and gluons will create a collimated spray of hadrons (\textit{jets})
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Electroweak Interaction and Higgs-Englert-Brout Mechanism}
\label{sec:smsusy:ew}

The theory of electroweak interactions is based on the symmetry group $SU(2)_\mathrm{L} \times U(1)_\mathrm{Y}$. This symmetry breaks at a scale around 100 GeV giving rise to the electromagnetic interaction, mediated by the photon, and to the weak interaction, mediated by the $Z$ (neutral currents) and $W^{\pm}$ bosons (charged currents). The number of mediators, four, is the same as the number of generators of the symmetry group. 

The $SU(2)_\mathrm{L}$ part of the symmetry group governs the weak interactions, and the suffix L indicates that only left-handed particles participate to them. Left-handed and right-handed fields ($\psi_L$ and $\psi_R$ respectively) are defined as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\psi_L = \frac{(1 - \gamma_5)}{2} \psi, \\
\psi_R = \frac{(1 + \gamma_5)}{2} \psi
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:sm:LR}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $(1 \pm \gamma_5)/2$ are the chirality projectors, and $\gamma_5$ is defined as $\gamma_5 = i \gamma^0 \gamma^1 \gamma^2 \gamma^3 $. Looking back at Eq. \ref{eq:sm:dirac}, it can be noted that, if we decompose the fermion filed into its left-handed and right-handed components, the derivative term keeps $\psi_L$ and $\psi_R$ separated, while the mass term mixes them:
\begin{equation}
-m \bar \psi \psi = -m \bar \psi P_L^2 \psi - m \bar \psi P_R^2 \psi
	= -m \bar \psi_R \psi_L - m \bar \psi_L \psi_R \
\end{equation}


The covariant derivative for the  $SU(2)_\mathrm{L} \times U(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ group is:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}^{\mu} = \partial^{\mu} + i \frac{g'}{2} B^\mu Y + ig W^\mu_k T^k
\label{eq:sm:covD}
\end{equation}

\noindent and substituting with this the regular derivative results in the interaction Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{int}^{EW} = -\frac{g'}{2} \left( \bar{\psi} \gamma_\mu Y \psi \right) B^\mu - g \sum_k \left( \bar{\psi} \gamma_\mu T^k \psi  \right) W_k^\mu
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have introduced $T^k$, the weak isospin operator, and $Y$, the hypercharge operator, and the respective coupling constants $g$ and $g'$. The quantum numbers of the $T^k$ and $Y$ operators relate to the electric change $Q$ through the  Gell-Mann Nishijima relation:

\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{Y}{2} + T_3
\label{eq:sm:Q}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $Y$ is the hypercharge quantum number and $T_3$ is the quantum number of the third component of the isospin. 

In the case of an $SU(2)$ symmetry, is not possible to add directly to the lagrangian a mass term for the vector bosons of the form in Eq. \ref{eq:lproca}, as it would spoil the $SU(2)$ local invariance. The Higgs-Englert-Brout mechanism solves this problem through Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) of the $SU(2)_\mathrm{L} \times U(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ invariance. The SSB is obtained by adding to the theory one extra isospin doublet of complex scalar components (\textit{Higgs field}):

\begin{equation}
	\Phi = \left( \begin{array}{c} \phi^+  \\ \phi^0 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
%	= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \begin{array}{c} \phi_1 + i \phi_2 \\ \phi_3 + i \phi_4 \end{array} \right)

This doublet has hypercharge Y=1 and isospin $T=\frac{1}{2}$; the first component is positively charged, while the second one is electrically neutral. The Lagrangian for this new field includes a kinetic and a potential term:

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_{\Phi} = ( \mathcal{D}_{\mu} \Phi)^{\dagger} (\mathcal{D}^{\mu} \Phi) - V(\Phi) 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathcal{D}_{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative defined in Eq. \ref{eq:sm:covD} and the potential $V(\Phi)$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
 V(\Phi) = - \mu^2 \Phi^{\dagger} \Phi + \lambda (\Phi^{\dagger} \Phi)^2 \, . \
	\label{eq:hpot}
\end{equation}

\noindent The two real parameters $\mu^2$ and $\lambda$ relate respectively to the mass term and the strength of the self-interaction term. The shape of the potential depends on the value of these parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\lambda < 0$, the potential does not present any stable minima, and is therefore unphysical.
\item If $\lambda > 0$ and $\mu^2 > 0$ there is only one solution to the minimization of the potential, $\Phi=0$. This case is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sm:higgsV}(a).
\item If $\lambda > 0$ and $\mu^2 < 0$, the field acquires a vacuum expectation values (VEV) as the minima is not at zero; it lies instead on the points of the circumference such that:
\begin{equation}
\Phi^{\dagger} \Phi = \frac{\mu^2}{2 \lambda}  \equiv \frac{v^2}{2}
\end{equation}
\noindent Fig. \ref{fig:sm:higgsV}(b) illustrates this case.
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:sm:higgsV}
\end{figure}

Up to this point the $SU(2)_\mathrm{L} \times U(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ symmetry is still intact, but the explicit choice of one of the infinite possible vacuum states for the Higgs field breaks the symmetry. According to the Goldstone theorem, the breaking of a continuous symmetry leads to the appearance of new massless scalar particles as allowed excitations. These new degrees of freedom can be absorbed by the existing gauge bosons, thus giving them mass. To meet the experimental requirement of a massless photon, the choice of the Higgs vacuum has not to break the electromagnetic symmetry ($U(1)_{EM}$), so the component of the Higgs doublet that acquires a VEV is the neutral one. We can then expand small excitations around the minimum:

\begin{equation}
\beq
	\Phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v + \phi \end{array} \right)
\label{eq:hvphi}
\eeq
\end{equation}

%The physical mass eigenstates are different from the interactions eigenstates, and can be recovered by rotating $B_\mu$ and $W^i_\mu$ and requiring that the field of the photon, $A_\mu$, has the correct quantum numbers. The transformation that relates the interaction eigenstates to the mass eigenstates is:


\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
W_\mu^\pm &= \frac{W_\mu^1 \mp W_\mu^2}{\sqrt{2}} \\
A_\mu &= B_\mu \cos\theta_W + W^3_\mu \sin\theta_W  \\
Z_\mu &= W^3_\mu \cos\theta_W - B_\mu \sin\theta_W
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:wein}
\end{equation}
