\section{Update with 2017 data-taking periods}
\label{sec:strong:r21}

The mild excess observed in the multi-bin region SR-0L-HH motivated checking the results with the 2017 data-taking periods 
as soon as they have become available. 
The analysis has been reproduced with all the data collected by the \gls{atlas} experiment in 2015, 2016 and 2017, 
for a total integrated luminosity of 79.8 \ifb. 
Both the cut-and-count and multi-bin regions have been updated, but in this section we present only the results 
of the multi-bin regions, since the main purpose is the follow up of the excess in the analysis of the 2015-2016 data.
