\chapter{Search for higgsino pair production}
\label{chap:ewk_prod}

This chapter presents a search for higgsino pair production, with decay to Higgs or $Z$ boson, 
focusing on the final states with four bottom quarks and \met. 
Two complementary searches target this signal model: the "high-mass" search,
which is the focus of this chapter, is optimized for 
cases with higgsinos heavy enough to produce sizable \met, while the "low-mass" search 
targets lower higgsino masses.
Section \ref{sec:ewk:sig} describes the signal models used to optimize and interpret the analysis. 
Section \ref{sec:ewk:sigbkg} discusses the strategy for the reconstruction of the candidate Higgs bosons in the event, 
and the variables that allow us to separate signal and background events. 
The definition of the analysis regions and their compositions are presented in Sections \ref{sec:ewk:SR} and 
\ref{sec:ewk:CRVR}, 
while Section \ref{sec:ewk:bkgcomp} discusses the background composition. 
Section \ref{sec:ewk:dataMC} shows the comparison between data and simulation in a kinematic regime close to that of the analysis regions. 
Section \ref{sec:ewk:syst} discusses the systematic uncertainties that are included in the analysis, and Section \ref{sec:ewk:results} 
presents the results. 
The interpretation of the results in terms of model-independent and model-dependent limits is presented in Section \ref{sec:ewk:interp}. 
The low-mass search is briefly described in Section \ref{sec:ewk:LM}, and Section \ref{sec:ewk:HMLM}  
presents the combined results of the two searches.
