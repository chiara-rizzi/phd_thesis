During the last four years I have had the opportunity to work and share fun times with a lot 
of brilliant and kind people, and this really been the heart of my PhD. 

% Aurelio
First of all, a big thank you goes to my PhD supervisor, Aurelio Juste, who has always been 
extremely supportive of my work; 
he let me free to explore my ideas, while being always available to provide guidance and support. 


% Tommaso
This PhD has not been the beginning of my adventure in ATLAS, and I am extremely thankful to 
Tommaso Lari, my supervisor in Milan during my bachelor and master theses,  
who thought me how to appreciate the most interesting aspects of high energy physics research 
and have fun while doing it.  

% IFAE
All the people who are (or have been) part of the IFAE group during my PhD have been helpful colleagues and 
good friends. All the post-docs in the group have always been available to help me with 
anything from technicalities to long discussions to gain a better understanding of many aspects of physics analyses. 
Carlos, Davide, Tal, Nicola and Julian have been great office mates in the last year. 
A special thank you goes to the people who shared with me my first years at IFAE: Mirko, to whom 
I've always looked up, and Loic and Trisha, who have helped me growing as a scientist and have offered me 
their friendship for the past four years.  
% Carlos, Davide, Tal, Trisha, Loic, Nicola, , Mirko, Julian. 

% multi-b team
Since the beginning of the PhD I have found in the multi-b team a group of people who helped me 
growing as a scientist and gaining independence in my work, 
in an atmosphere that always enhanced collaboration and friendship.  
A special thanks to Max and Giordon, with whom I've shared a lot of nights working late and 
discussions that helped making all of our results great. 

% Milano people
People who pass by the Milano ATLAS group never really leave it. 
During the last few years a lot of people that are currently studying in Milan, or that like me 
studies in Milan to then continue working somewhere else, created a lively CERN-based community that 
makes me feel closer to home. 
Thanks to Alessandra, Carlo, Claudia, Davide, Giacomo, Lorenzo, Maria Giulia, Sonia and Stefano and the rest of the 
lunch crew! 

% Topolino 
I have said thank you to a lot of people who contributed to make these last few years a memorable experience. 
But it has not been always easy. There have been days when I was so stressed about missed deadlines, 
about failures at multi-tasking, that 
I would barely speak to anybody. 
Days when I doubted I could make it. 
But I've had one person who never doubted that I'd make it, and who makes me smile every single day independently 
of of everything else. 
I am lucky enough that I can't really say "I would never have made it without you", 
because I don't know how it would have been without you, you have always been there for me.
