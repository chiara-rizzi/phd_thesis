During the last four years I have had the opportunity to work and share fun times with a lot 
of brilliant and kind people, and this really been at the heart of my PhD. 

\par\bigskip 

% Aurelio
First of all, I would like to thank you my PhD supervisor, Prof. Aurelio Juste, who has always been 
extremely supportive of my work; 
he let me free to explore my ideas, while being always available to provide guidance and support. 

\par\bigskip 

% Tommaso
This PhD has not been the beginning of my journey in High Energy Physics, and I am extremely grateful to 
Dott. Tommaso Lari, who supervised me during my bachelor and master thesis at the University of Milan, 
and continued begin a reference point also during my PhD; 
He thought me how to appreciate the most interesting aspects of high energy physics research 
and have fun while doing it.  

\par\bigskip 
 
% IFAE all
Aurelio and Martine have been able to create a great working environment in the IFAE group, and 
all the people who are (or have been) part of the IFAE group during my PhD have been helpful colleagues and 
good friends.  
Carlos, Davide, Julian, Mirko, Nicola and Tal have been great office mates in the past few years.  
All the post-docs in the group have always been available to help me with 
anything from technicalities to long discussions to gain a better understanding of many aspects of physics analyses, 
and I am particularly indebted to Loic and Trisha, who have helped me growing as a scientist and have offered me 
their friendship for the past four years. 

\par\bigskip

% multi-b team
Since the beginning of the PhD I have found in the multi-b team a 
group of people who kept me motivated and helped me 
gaining independence in my work, 
in an atmosphere that always enhanced collaboration and friendship.  
I am particularly grateful to Max, whose expertise, energy and dedication have been 
invaluable ingredients in building a wonderful team, 
and to Giordon, who has always been available to patiently help me and many others (and 
to whom goes also the credit for the super pretty event display on the cover). 

\par\bigskip
% SUSY conveners and sub-conveners 
I have had the chance to work with many great people in the ATLAS SUSY group, and 
I want to thank particularly Iacopo, Till and Zach, who have been conveners of the group,
and all the subconveners who in the past years 
have put a lot of effort and passion in organizing the group and providing to each 
analysis support and critical review. 

\par\bigskip 

% Milano people
%People who pass by the Milano ATLAS group never really leave it. 
During the last few years a lot of people that are currently studying in Milan, or that like me 
studied in Milan to then continue working somewhere else, created a lively CERN-based community that 
makes me feel closer to home. 
Thanks to Alessandra, Carlo, Davide, Giacomo, Giulia, Maria Giulia and Stefano and the rest of the 
lunch crew! A special thank you goes to Claudia, Sonia and Lorenzo who have helped me reviewing this document and 
helped me a lot in the last-minute panic moments. 

\par\bigskip 
% Mamma papa' e Laura 
My family has been supportive of my choices for my entire life. 
Without the help and love of my mom, my dad and Laura I would not have even been able to start this work. 
Thank you for giving me all the opportunities I could ask for. 

\par\bigskip 
% Topolino 
Throughout these years I've had one person who never doubted that I'd make it, 
who lived with me through the darkest times of missed deadlines 
and who still makes me smile every single day independently 
of of everything else. 
Thank you Giuseppe for knowing me better than anybody else, 
and yet deciding to share your life with me! 

%I have said thank you to a lot of people who contributed to make these last few years a memorable experience. 
%But it has not been always easy. There have been days when I was so stressed about missed deadlines, 
%about failures at multi-tasking, that 
%I would barely speak to anybody. 
%Days when I doubted I could make it. 

%I am lucky enough that I can't really say "I would never have made it without you", 
%because I don't know how it would have been without you, you have always been there for me.
