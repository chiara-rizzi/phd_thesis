During the last four years I have had the opportunity to work and share fun times with a lot 
of brilliant and kind people, and this really been the heart of my PhD. 

First of all, a big thank you goes to my PhD supervisor, Aurelio Juste, who has always been 
extremely supportive of my work; 
he let me free to explore my ideas, while being always available to provide guidance and support, 
letting me take the best experience out of this PhD. 

This PhD has not been the beginning of my adventure in ATLAS, and I am extremely thankful to 
Tommaso Lari, my supervisor in Milan during my bachelor and master theses,  
who thought me how to appreciate the most interesting aspects of high energy physics research 
and have fun while doing it.  

All the people who are (or have been) part of the IFAE group during my PhD have been helpful colleagues and 
good friends: 
% Carlos, Davide, Tal, Trisha, Loic, Nicola, , Mirko, Julian. 

Since the beginning of the PhD I have found in the people working at the multi-b analysis a team 
that made. 

I have said thank you to a lot of people who contributed to make these last few years a memorable experience. 
But it has not been always easy. There have been days when I was so stressed about missed deadlines, 
about failures at multi-tasking, that 
I would barely speak to anybody. 
Days when I doubted I could make it. 
But I've had one person who never doubted that I'd make it, and who makes me smile every single day independently 
of of everything else. 
I am lucky enough that I can't really say "I would never have made it without you", 
because I don't know how it would have been without you, you have always been there for me.
