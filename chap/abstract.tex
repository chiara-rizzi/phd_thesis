In this thesis, two searches for \gls{susy} are presented, 
that target final states with multiple top and bottom quarks.

The first search targets gluino pair production where each gluino decays through a stop
(Gtt model) or a sbottom (Gbb model) 
to respectively four top or bottom quarks and the \gls{lsp};
in both cases the final state has a high multiplicity of $b$-jets (collimated 
sprays of particles originating from the hadronization of $b$-quarks) and 
missing transverse momentum (\met) originating from the \gls{lsp} 
that escapes undetected. 

The second search targets a \gls{ggm} model of Higgsino pair production, 
where each Higgsino then decays to a Higgs boson and 
a gravitino, which in this case is the \gls{lsp}. 
This search focuses on the cases where both Higgs bosons decay to a 
pair of $b$-quarks.
This is the first \gls{atlas} analysis targeting this signature, that had been 
previously considered only in searches performed by the \gls{cms} collaboration.

Both searches use the data collected by the \gls{atlas} experiment at the \gls{lhc} 
between 2015 and 2016, at a center-of-mass energy  \cmtre TeV,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 \ifb.
The gluino search, optimized for 36 \ifb, is also extended using the data collected in 2017, 
for a total integrated luminosity of 79.8 \ifb.

No significant excess is observed in any of the search regions, 
and the results are used to 
set limits on the production of supersymmetric particles. 
The gluino analyses excludes at 95\% confidence level gluino masses up to 2.25 TeV for the Gtt model 
and 2.17 TeV for the Gbb model, for neutralino masses below 800 GeV.
The Higgsino analysis excludes \mhino in the range 240-880 GeV, assuming 
that the Higgsino decays to Higgs boson and gravitino with 100\% branching ratio.
