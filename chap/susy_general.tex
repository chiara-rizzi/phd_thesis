\section{Background Processes and their modelling}

This section describes the main background processes from the \gls{sm} in the analysis regions and the way they are 
modeled in the analyses discussed in the next two chapters. In general, the modelling is based on \gls{mc} simulations for
all the backgrounds, except multi-jet which is emulated with a data-driven technique.
For the main background, pair production of top quark pairs, the shape of the different distributions is obtained from \gls{mc}
but the normalization is data-driven, derived in specifically designed \gls{cr} as described in Section \ref{sec:analyses:cr}.

\subsection{Top quark pair production}

Top quark pair production constitutes the main source of background in all the analysis regions.
