\chapter{Common Aspects to Multi-b SUSY Searches}
\label{chap:multib_general}

The main results presented in this thesis are the two analyses described in Chapter \ref{chap:strong_prod} and Chapter \ref{chap:ewk_prod}. While these analyses target two different \gls{susy} models they have many commonalities, since they both target \gls{susy} models leading to final states rich in b-jets and \met. This Chapter highlights these common aspects: Section \ref{sec:simplified_models} describes the philosophy of simplified models, used to design the signal models, Section \ref{sec:common_backgrounds} focuses on the background sources from \gls{sm} processes and how they are modeled in the analyses.

\section{Analysis Strategy}

\section{Background Processes and their modelling}
\label{sec:common_backgrounds}

This section describes the main background processes from the \gls{sm} in the analysis regions and the way they are 
modeled in the analyses discussed in the next two chapters. In general, the modelling is based on \gls{mc} simulations for
all the backgrounds, except multi-jet which is emulated with a data-driven technique.
For the main background, pair production of top quark pairs, the shape of the different distributions is obtained from \gls{mc}
but the normalization is data-driven, derived in specifically designed \gls{cr} as described in Section \ref{sec:analyses:cr}.
Section \ref{sec:common_obj_def} focuses on the definition of the physic objects, and Section \ref{sec:common_syst} introduces the main sources of 
systematic uncertainties.
