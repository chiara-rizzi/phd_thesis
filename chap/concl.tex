This document presented two searches targeting \gls{susy} signals leading to final states with 
high $b$-jet multiplicity, using the data collected by the \gls{atlas} experiment at the \gls{lhc} 
between 2015 and 2016, at a center-of-mass energy  \cmtre TeV. 
This dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 36 \ifb.

The first analysis searches for gluino pair production where each gluino decays through a stop or a sbottom 
to respectively four top or bottom quarks and the \gls{lsp}, leading to a final state with four $b$-jets and 
missing transverse momentum (\met). 


The second search targets \gls{ggm} model of Higgsino pair production, where each Higgsino then decays to a Higgs boson and 
a gravitino, which in this case is the \gls{lsp}. The search is performed in the channel with four $b$-jets, originating from 
the decay of the two Higgs bosons, and \met. 
This was the first \gls{atlas} analysis targeting this signature, that had been 
previously considered only in searches performed by the \gls{cms} collaboration.
