This document presented two searches targeting \gls{susy} signals leading to final states with 
high $b$-jet multiplicity, using the data collected by the \gls{atlas} experiment at the \gls{lhc} 
between 2015 and 2016, at a center-of-mass energy  \cmtre TeV. 
This dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 \ifb.

The first analysis searches for gluino pair production where each gluino decays through a stop or a sbottom 
to respectively four top or bottom quarks and the \gls{lsp}, leading to a final state with four $b$-jets and 
missing transverse momentum (\met). 
This analysis employs two different strategies: cut-and-count, with several non-orthogonal \glspl{sr} optimized to 
maximize the discovery significance for selected benchmark models, and multi-bin, with orthogonal \glspl{sr} 
that are statistically combined in the maximum-likelihood fit 
to maximize the exclusion power of the analysis. 
In all the \glspl{sr} semi-leptonic \ttbar+jets constitutes the dominant background.
No significant excess is found in any of the analysis regions. 
The largest deviation between expected and observed number of events 
is in SR-0L-HH, one of the multi-bin \glspl{sr}, and it has a significance of approximately 
2.3 standard deviations. 
Exclusion limits in the m(\gluino)-m(\ninoone) are set for the two simplified models assuming 
100\% \gls{br} for the gluino into tt\ninoone and bb\ninoone, denoted as "Gtt" and "Gbb" respectively.
In the case of the Gtt model, the expected and observed limit for massless neutralino 
are 2.14 and 1.97 TeV respectively; the main reason of the difference is the excess in SR-0L-HH.
Also for the Gbb model the observed limit is slightly weaker than the expected one: 
while the expected limit for massless neutralino is 2.01 TeV, the observed is 1.92 TeV.
The results of this analysis are reinterpreted also allowing a variable \gls{br} of the gluino 
into tt\ninoone, bb\ninoone and tb\chinoonepm. 

The mild excess in SR-0L-HH has been verified also with the 2017 dataset; together 
with the 2015 and 2016 data-taking periods, this leads to a total integrated luminosity 
of 79.8 \ifb. 
The update of the analysis did not find an excess in SR-0L-HH, and the increase in luminosity 
allowed to set more stringent limits.




The second search targets \gls{ggm} model of Higgsino pair production, where each Higgsino then decays to a Higgs boson and 
a gravitino, which in this case is the \gls{lsp}. The search is performed in the channel with four $b$-jets, originating from 
the decay of the two Higgs bosons, and \met. 
This was the first \gls{atlas} analysis targeting this signature, that had been 
previously considered only in searches performed by the \gls{cms} collaboration.
