\section{The ATLAS Experiment}
\label{sed:cern:atlas}

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)\cite{atlas:atlas} is the largest of the LHC detectors: as it is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:atlas} it measures 44 meters in length and 25 meters in height, and its weights is about 700 tons. To be fully functional in the LHC environment,  ATLAS needs to be fast as it needs to be able to resolve the collisions resulting from consecutive bunches (which are interspaced by 25 ns) and radiation resistant.

\end{figure}

The ATLAS physics program covers a large variety of topics: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard Model processes can be measured at the LHC at energies never reached before, and being sensitive to them is essential both to provide accurate measurements and to use them as candles to calibrate the detector. 
\item The discovery of the Higgs boson was one of the main goals of the LHC, and after its observation in 2013 the focus moved on measuring its properties. 
\item Top quarks are produced in large amount at the LHC, and the study of the properties of this particle can both probe the SM and set limits on BSM theories.
\item The LHC offers an incredible opportunity to discover BSM physics, and ATLAS needs to be ready to identify its signs.
\item Despite the ALICE detector is specifically designed to study heavy-ion collisions, ATLAS also carries out an heavy-ion program.
\end{itemize}

To cope with the wide range of types and energies (from few GeV to several TeV) of the particles that need to be identified, ATLAS relies on a sequence of subdetectors nested in a cylindrical geometry, that follow the general schema discussed in Section \ref{sec:detectors:identification}: close to the interaction point we find the inner detector (ID), embedded in a solenoidal magnetic field of 2 T. The following layers are the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeters (ECal and HCal), and the outermost part is occupied by the muon system, where muons are bent by a 4-T toroidal magnetic field. All of these components are described in the next sections.

\subsection{Coordinate System}

ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system, with its origin at the nominal interaction point. The $z$-axis follows the beam direction, while in the transverse plane the $y$-axis points upward and the $x$axis toward the LHC center. Positive and negative values of the $z$-axis identify respectively the A-side and the C-side of the detector. When spherical coordinates are used, the \textit{azimuthal angle} $\phi$ is defined starting from the $x$-axis, and ranges between $-\pi$ and $\pi$; the \textit{polar angle} $\theta$ is defined starting from the $z$-axis and takes values between $0$ and $\pi$. Often the polar angle is substituted by the \textit{pseudorapidity}: 
 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:eta}
\eta = - \ln \tan \frac{\theta}{2}
\end{equation}

which, in the limit of massless particles, is equivalent to the \textit{rapidity}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:y}
y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{E + p_z}{E - p_z} \; ,
\end{equation}

where $E$ is the energy of the particle and $p_z$ its momentum projected on the $z$-axis. The $\eta$-$\phi$ plane is used to define the angular separation of two objects in the detector:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:dR}
\Delta R = \sqrt{ \Delta \phi^2 + \Delta \eta^2  } \; .
\end{equation}

Since protons are composite particles, and the hard scattering happens between its constituents, the longitudinal momentum of the partons is unknown. It is therefore useful to define the \textit{transverse momentum} as the projection of the momentum on the ($x$,$y$) plane: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cern:pt}
p_T = \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2} \; ,
\end{equation}

where $p_{x(y)}$ are the projection of the momentum along the $x$-($y$-)axis.




\subsection{Magnet System}
\label{sec:atlas:magnets}

The two segments of the ATLAS detector that are dedicated to tracking, the ID and the muon spectrometers, are embedded in two separate magnetic fields. A schematic overview of the ATLAS magnetic system is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:magnet}.
\label{sec:cern:atlasmagnets}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{figures/atlas/magnets}}
\caption{Layout of the ATLAS magnet system. Figure from Ref. \cite{Goodson}}
\label{fig:atlas:magnet}
\end{figure}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:dec:tracking}, the magnetic field configurations that are more suitable for a detector with cylindrical symmetry are solenoidal and toroidal. The bending of the charged particles in the ATLAS ID is caused by an axial 2-T solenoidal field, provided by the \textit{central solenoid} \cite{YAMAMOTO200853}. This magnet is 5.8-m long, has an inner diameter of 2.46 m and an outer diameter of 2.56. The wounded coil is made of an Al-stabilised NbTi conductor, and is powered with a 7.73 kA current. 


In the muon system, a solenoid would be disadvantageous in the measurement of forward muons, since the resultant magnetic field would not be perpendicular to the trajectory of those particles. The usage of a toroid to provide the outer magnetic field solves this problem. The main drawback of this choice is that, in order to obtain the same intensity of the magnetic field, a toroid needs more current than a solenoid (20.5 kA for 4 T).
The ATLAS toroid system is divided into two subsystems, to allows for an easier design, as well as access to the core part of the detector.
The \textit{barrel toroid} \cite{ATLAS:1997ac} provides a peak field of 3.9 T in the cylindrical shell between the calorimeters and the end of the muon spectrometer, and consists of eight coils contained in individual vacuum vessels.  
The \textit{end-cap toroids} \cite{ATLAS:1997ab} provide the magnetic field necessary to bend the muons in the end-cap region of the spectrometer, and each of them consists of eight coils building a single cold mass, originating a peak field of 4.1 T. 



\subsection{Inner Detector}
\label{sec:atlas:id}

The main purposes of ATLAS inner detector \cite{ATLAS:1997ag,ATLAS:1997af} are to provide a good momentum resolution of the charged particles produces in the collisions and to allow the determination of secondary vertexes. The size of the ID is determined on one side by the beam pipe and on the other side by the beginning of the ECal. The total length is 5.4 m, that allows a coverage up to $|\eta|<$2.5.
The ID is divided into a barrel ID, whose schema is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:id}, and two end-cap regions, covering respectively the pseudorapidity regions $|\eta|<$1.2 and 1.2$<|\eta|<$2.5. In both, a mixture of gaseous and silicon detectors is used to maximize the performance and reduce the costs. The three components that compose the ID are the pixel detector, the semi-conductor tracker and the transition radiation tracker, discussed in the following paragraphs.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figures/atlas/inner_detector}}
\caption{Layout of the ATLAS inner detector. Figure from Ref. \cite{Potamianos:2016ptf}}
\label{fig:atlas:id}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Pixel Detector}
The innermost layer of the ID is the \textit{pixel detector}, divided into barrel and end-cap regions. During the Long Shutdown after the LHC Run1, the ID was subject to important upgrades \cite{Potamianos:2016ptf}. The main one is the addition of a fourth pixel layer in the barrel, in addition to the three already existing ones, the insertable B-Layer (IBL) \cite{Capeans:1291633}, that is positioned 3.33 cm away from the interaction point. In order to locate a detector so close to the interaction point, the beam pipe had to be replaces with a thinner one. The IBL is 72.4 cm long along the $z$ direction, and consists of 14 staves that provide full coverage in azimuthal angle. Each stave contains 20 modules, 12 with planar silicon sensors and 8 with 3D pixel sensors \cite{1748-0221-7-11-P11010}, and each module has 144$\times$328 pixels with the size of 50$\times$250 $\mu$m$^2$, for a total of over 12 million pixel in the entire IBL. The size of the pixels leads to a resolution of 40 $\mu$m in the longitudinal direction and 8 $\mu$m in the perpendicular one. The three outer pixel layers are located at 5.05, 8.85 and 12.5 cm from the interaction point. Each module contains 80 pixels of 50$\times$400 $\mu$m$^2$, leading to a spatial resolution of 115 and 10 $\mu$m respectively in the longitudinal and transverse direction. 
The two end caps, on the two sides of the detector, consist of three wheels each, with a radius of 34 cm and located at 49.5, 58.8 and 65.0 cm from the interaction point. 
To ensure a good performance, the ID detectors need to be kept at a low and stable temperature, between -15$^{\circ}$ C and 5$^{\circ}$ C for the IBL, between -15$^{\circ}$ C and -10$^{\circ}$ C for the other layers.

\subsubsection*{Semi-Conductor Tracker}
The ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) is composed by 4088 silicon micro-strip modules with binary readout mounted on carbon fibre composite structures and is organized in four cylinders in the barrel and nine disks in each of the forward regions \cite{Jackson:sct}. The cylinders have a radii of 30.0, 37.3, 44.7 and 52.0 cm and provide a coverage for $|\eta|<$1.1-1.4, while the disks cover the region with 1.1-1.4$<|\eta|<$2.5. 
2112 of the 4088 SCT modules are in the barrel, and contain single-sided p-in-n silicon strips, with a pitch of 80 $\mu$m. In the module, the strip sensors are positioned back to back with an angle of 40 mrad, to be able to access information on the $z$-coordinate as well. The end-cap modules use strips with width between 56.9 and 94.2 $\mu$m. These choices lead to a spatial resolution of 17 $\mu$m in the transverse direction and 580 $\mu$m in the longitudinal one. Also the SCR components need to be kept at a low temperature, between -15$^{\circ}$ C and -5$^{\circ}$ C.

\subsubsection*{Transition Radiation Tracker}

The transition-radiation tracker (TRT) is the outermost layer of the ID. In the barrel it consists of 52544 straw tubes with a length of 1.5 m disposed parallel to the beam direction, while each end-cap contains 122880 straw tubes 0.4-m long disposed perpendicularly to the beam axis. Each tube is 4 mm in diameter, and has in the inside gold plated tungsten wire as anode with a diameter of 31 $\mu$m. The tubes are filled with a mixture of 70\% Xe, 27\% CO$_2$ and 3\% O$_2$; due to a gas leakage, in 2016 part of the TRT tubes have been filled with a cheaper mixture of 80\% Ar and 20\% CO$_2$. The TRT is the only subdetector of the ID that has a pseudorapidity coverage up to $|\eta|<$2. The TRT provides tracking information only in the (r-$\phi$) plane, with a resolution of 130 $\mu$m.


\subsection{Calorimeters}
\label{sec:atlas:calo}

The ATLAS calorimeter system is located outside the ID and the magnetic field of the solenoid, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:calo}. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) is closer to the interaction point, while the hadronic calorimeter (HCal) is on the outside; both systems have a barrel and an end-cap part. 
The combined thickness of the calorimeter system is about 11 interaction lengths to allow a good reconstruction of the energy imbalance in the event, which is a measure of the energy carried away by neutral weakly-interacting particles, and the total pseudorapidity coverage is up to $|\eta|<4.9$. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/atlas/calorimeters}}
\caption{Layout of the ATLAS calorimeter system. Figure from Ref. \cite{atlas:atlas}}
\label{fig:atlas:calo}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab:atlas:cal:reso} shows the energy resolution of the different subsystems. As expected from the discussion in Section \ref{sec:dec:calo}, the resolution is better for electromagnetic showers than for the hadronic ones. For example, a 1-GeV particle detected in the ECal has an energy resolution of about 19\%, while 50\% (100\%) if detected in the HCal barrel (end-caps). On the other hand, a 1-TeV particle has an energy resolution of 0.7\% in the ECal and 3\% (10\%) in  HCal barrel (end-caps), and in this case the resolution is dominated by the constant term.

\caption{(a) Schema of a barrel module of the ATLAS ECal. (b) Accordion shape of the metal plates of the ECal.}
\label{fig:atlas:lar}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}

The ECal is a sampling calorimeter with liquid argon (LAr) as active material and lead plates as absorber, both in the barrel and in the end caps. The lead plates have a characteristic accordion shape and, in the barrel, are oriented in the radial direction. Before the ECal, a presampler provides the information necessary to reconstruct the amount of energy lost in the passive material of the solenoid. The design of a LAr barrel module is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:lar}(a), where it is possible to see the segmentation in three layers with decreasing granularity: the first layer is finely segmented in pseudorapiditu, with strips of $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = $ 0.0031 $\times$ 0.098. The second layer has towers of $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = $ 0.025 $\times$ 0.025 to measure the clusters, while the third layer has broader towers of $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = $ 0.05 $\times$ 0.0245 to provide an estimate of the energy propagating beyond the ECal. In the LAr barrel offers pseudorapidity coverage up to $|\eta|<$1.475, and the thickness of the detector varies from 22 $X_0$ at $\eta=0$ to 33 $X_0$ at $|\eta|=1.3$. 
Each of the two end-cap regions consists of two coaxial wheels, of eight module each, that cover the region 1.375$<|\eta|<$3.2, with a thickness varying between 26 and 36 $X_0$ for the inner wheel, 24 and 38 $X_0$ for the outer wheel. The end-cap modules are divided into two layers, again with decreasing granularity.


\subsubsection*{Hadronic Calorimeter}

The hadronic calorimeter is composed of three subsystems with different technologies: the tile barrel calorimeter (TileCal) is a sampling calorimeter with plastic scintillator as active material and steal as absorber, the hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) uses copper as absorber and liquid argon as scintillator, while the forward calorimeter (FCal) uses again liquid argon in the active layer but has tungsten rods embedded in a copper matrix as absorber. The choice of the materials is driven by having detectors more resistant to radiation in the forward region, where the flux of particles is more abundant. 

TileCal covers the pseudorapidity region with $|\eta|<$1.7, and is divided into a central long barrel (LB), 5.8-m long, and two extended barrels (EB), 2.6-m long; the TileCal inner radius is 2.28 m, and the outer radius 4.25 m. Each barrel is divided in 64 modules, disposed on the $\phi$ direction and each having the size of 0.1 radians. Each module is further segmented radially into three layers with thicknesses of about 1.5, 4.1 and 1.8 interaction lengths in the LB and 1.5, 2.6 and 3.3 interaction lengths in the EB; a schematic of one module is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:tile}(a). Ionizing particles passing through the plastic scintillator (polystyrene) produce ultra-violet light, which is then collected at the two edges of each tile and converted to the longer wavelength of visible light by wavelength-shifting fibers. The fibers, with a diameter of 1 mm each, transmit the light to the readout photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) located in the grinder.

\caption{(a) Schematic representation of a TileCal module and its interface with the optical readout. (b) TileCal modules before installation.}
\label{fig:atlas:tile}
\end{figure}

An approximately projective geometry, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:tile_cells}, is provided by the grouping of the readout fibres into the PMTs: this defines a cell structure, and each cell has dimension $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = $ 0.1 $\times$ 0.1 in the first two layers and $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = $ 0.2 $\times$ 0.1 in the third layer. Special cells cover the gap region between the LB and the EB: the gap scintillators in the pseudorapidity region 1.0$<|\eta|<$1.2 and crack scintillators in the region 1.2$<|\eta|<$1.6, in front of the LAr end caps.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/atlas/tile_cells.pdf}}
\caption{Layout of the projective geometry of the TileCal cells.}
\label{fig:atlas:tile_cells}
\end{figure}

The HEC shares the same cryogenic system as the ECal end caps, and covers the region with 1.5$<|\eta|<$3.2. Liquid argon is more resistant to radiation than the plastic scintillator used in TileCal, and is therefore the preferred choice in the end-cap region. Each side of the HEC consists of two wheels with outer radius of 2.03 m, and each wheel is composed by 32 identical modules. The electromagnetic signal produced in the LAr is collected by catodes on the plates. 

The FCal provides coverage in the forward region with 3.1$<|\eta|<$4.9. The FCal modules are located at high pseudorapidity, at a distance of 4.7 m along the $z$-axis from the interaction point.


\subsection{Muon Spectrometer}

The muon spectrometer (MS) \cite{ATLAS:1997ad}, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:muon}, is the outer layer of the ATLAS detector, and is located in the magnetic field produces by the 4-T toroidal magnets described in Section \ref{sec:atlas:magnets}. It consists of four different muon chambers, two dedicated to the precise measurement of the muon tracks traversing the detector, and two aiming at providing fast event selection for the trigger system. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figures/atlas/muon}}
\caption{Layout of the ATLAS muon system. Figure from Ref. \cite{atlas:atlas}}
\label{fig:atlas:muon}
\end{figure}

The two systems dedicated to precision measurement are the \textit{monitored drift tubes} (MDTs)  and the \textit{cathode strip chambers} (CSCs), both present in barrel and end caps. The MDTs are proportional drift chambers covering the region $|\eta|<$2.7; they are made of aluminium tubes with a diameter of 30 mm and a length between 700 and 6300 mm, and a cathode wire made of an alloy of tungsten (97\%) and rhenium (3\%). The filling gas is a mixture of Ar, N$_2$, and CH$_4$ with percentages respectively of 91\%, 4\% and 5\%. The CSCs are multi-wire proportional chambers that cover the region with 2.0$<|\eta|<$2.7, where the shorter drift time of this detector (30 ns compared to the 480 ns of the MDTs) allows to cope better with the increase in particle flux in the forward region. The anode wires in the CSCs are made of the same tungsten-rhenium alloy of the MDTs and have a 2.54 mm pitch, which is the same distance separating them from the copper cathode strips, creating a symmetric cell. The gas inside the chamber is a mixture of 30\% Ar, 50\% CO$_2$, and 20\% CF$_4$. The spatial resolution is 40 $\mu$m in the bending plane and 5 mm in the perpendicular one.

The muon trigger system needs to be able to identify events with energetic muons in a timescale compatible with assigning them to the correct bunch crossing, that at the nominal value are spaced by 25 ns. The two trigger chambers are the \textit{resistive plate chambers} (RPCs) and the \textit{thin gap chambers} (TGCs). The RPCs are arranged in three layers in the barrel region, outside the outermost MDT layer. Each narrow chamber consists of two parallel resistive bakelite plates and is filled with a mixture of 94.7\% C$_2$H$_2$F$_4$, 5\% Iso-C$_4$H$_{10}$, and 0.3\% SF$_6$. The signal is readout by metal plates through capacitive coupling, providing a time resolution of 1.5 ns, while the space resolution is about 1 cm. The RPC also provides the $\phi$ coordinate for the track, which is not measured by the MDTs. The TGCs are multi-wire proportional chambers located in the end caps, filled with a mixture of 55\% CO$_2$ and 45\% n-C$_5$H$_{12}$; with respect to the CSCs, are characterized by a distance between the cathode and the anode shorter than the anode pitch. The pseudorapidity coverage is 1.05$<|\eta|<$2.7 for tracking and 1.05$<|\eta|<$2.4 for triggering; the time response is similar to the one of the RPCs, while the spatial resolution is better: between 2 and 7 mm. 

\subsection{Luminosity Measurement}

An accurate determination of the luminosity is important both for SM measurements, where often the luminosity uncertainty is one of the most relevant ones, and for BSM searches, where a precise background estimate is a key ingredient to be sensitive to a signal. In the ATLAS detector the luminosity measurement is performed with redundancy by multiple luminometers that use different technologies and algorithms, to allow a better determination of the final number and to assign systematic uncertainties. The instantaneous luminosity in Eq. \ref{eq:cern:lumi} can also be expressed following the conventions in Ref. \cite{Aaboud:2016hhf} as product of the number of bunch crossings and the average luminosity per bunch cross $<\mathcal{L}_b>$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = N_b <\mathcal{L}_b> = N_b \frac{f <\mu>}{\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}} } \; .
\label{eq:atlas:lumi}
\end{equation}

With respect to the nomenclature of Eq. \ref{eq:cern:lumi}, $<\mu>$ is the average pile-up per bunch crossing and $\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}$ the inelastic $p-p$ cross section. Because of the finite acceptance and efficiency of the detector, what is measured is:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_b = \frac{f <\mu_\mathrm{vis}>}{\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}} } \; ,
\end{equation}

where $<\mu_\mathrm{vis}>$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}}$ are the product of the corresponding quantities in Eq. \ref{eq:atlas:lumi} and the acceptance and efficiency of the detector. Out of these two quantities, $<\mu_\mathrm{vis}>$ is directly measurable during the collisions, while $\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}}$ is determined with the \textit{van der Meer} (vdM) method, carried out in the dedicated vdM runs. These are special runs with low bunch intensity and number of bunches, where a variation (scan) of the overlap of the two beams in the $x$ and $y$ directions is performed; the beam parameters and the peak of visible interaction rate per bunch crossing during the scan can be used to determine the visible cross section and therefore calibrate each subsystem. 

The relevant quantity in physics analyses is the integrated luminosity over a defined period of time. The basic time unit over which the integrated luminosity is computed and stored is the \textit{luminosity block} (LB), whose duration is defined by the ATLAS trigger system and is typically about one minute. The data contained in each LB is collected with the same detector conditions, and the integrated luminosity is computed as average instantaneous luminosity multiplied by the LB time duration.

ATLAS has two primary specifically-designed luminosimeters, LUCID-2 (\textit{LUminosity measurements using Cherenkov Integrating Detector}) and BCM (\textit{Beam Conditions Monitor}), whose results are compared with the one obtained by other ATLAS subsystem that measure luminosity through quantities that are sensitive to it, like the number of tracks or the flow of particles.

\subsubsection*{Bunch-by-bunch Luminometers}

The two dedicated luminosimeters are able to provide information for individual bunch crossing, each labeled by a \textit{bunch-crossing identifier} (BCID).

BCM consists of four $8 \times 8$ mm$^2$ diamond sensors, located at $z= \pm 184$ m form the interaction point and disposed in a cross shape around the beam pipe, at $|\eta| = 4.2$. Beside luminosity measurements, BCM is also used to recognize beam losses so that the beam can be dumped before damaging the silicon detectors. 

LUCID is located 17 m form the interaction point, at $5.6 < |\eta| < 6.0$, and consists on each side of 16 Cherenkov detectors built by aluminum tubes with a diameter of 10 mm. Cherenkov radiation is produced at the passage of particles through the quartz windows of PMTs. A signal over threshold produces a hit for that bunch crossing.

%\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Tracker-based Algorithms}

The ID, described in Sec. \ref{sec:atlas:id}, records the passage of charged particles as tracks. The number of such charged tracks in each bunch crossing is proportional to the luminosity, and can be used as $<\mu_\mathrm{vis}>$ if averaged over a LB. 
During collisions partial data, selected with a random trigger that has the same probability of firing for each colliding bunch, are recorded in a dedicated stream. Because of the high number of colliding bunches, to achieve enough statistical precision the luminosity is provided as integrated over the LB; instead, during vdM scans, bunch-by-bunch luminosity can be provided. 
% chiara: indicate which track types have been used in 2015-2016 and which in 2017
The reconstruction of the tracks used in this process is described in Sec. \ref{sec:reco:tracks}.

\subsubsection*{Bunch-integrating Devices}

The long-term stability of the luminosity measurement provided by BCM, LUCID and the track system is checked with devices that are sensitive to the flux of particles through the detector. This technique allow to measure only instantaneous luminosity integrated over a time of a few seconds, and not bunch-by-bunch.

A first subdetector capable of providing such measurement is TileCal, described in Sec. \ref{sec:atlas:calo}. The current generated by the PMTs is proportional to the total number of particles; this current is not read through the digital readout system, but through an integrator system sensitive to currents between 0.01 nA and 1.2 $\mu$A over a time window of 10-20 ms. The current induced in different cells varies largely with the cell position: the ones that receive a larger amount of particles are the ones around $|\eta|=1.25$ and in the inner part of the detector (as the hadronic shower is stopped while it passes through the calorimeter). The TileCal luminosity measurement is not calibrated during vdM scans, but is instead equalized to LUCID or the track measurement for one specific run, and the calibration constant between current and luminosity allows to measure the luminosity also in different runs.

Other two systems used in the luminosity determination are the LAr-based calorimeters in the end caps, the electromagnetic one and the FCal. In both systems the high-voltage (HV) system maintain a constant voltage by supplying a continuous injection of current that counterbalances the voltage drop caused by the flux of particles in a certain sector. The measurement of this current provides a luminosity measurement. Also LAr systems are not calibrated during the vdM scan, but each HV run is calibrated to the baseline luminosity algorithm over a physics run.  


\subsection{Trigger System}
\label{sec:cern:trigger}

With the nominal bunch spacing of 25 ns, the LHC produces collisions at a frequency of 40 MHz. This exceeds by several order of magnitude the current possibilities to write events to disk, therefore the ATLAS \textit{trigger and data acquisition system} (TDAQ) selects and records the events that are considered interesting for analyses. The TDAQ system has been updated between Run1 and Run2 \cite{Aaboud:2016leb} and it consists now of a  hardware \textit{Level1} (L1) trigger and s single software-based \textit{high-level trigger} (HLT). L1 is the first step in the chain, and reduces the output rate from 40 MHz to about 100 kHz. It uses reduced-granularity information from all the calorimeter systems and form the muon RPC and TGS to find events with interesting objects and saves the information about the \textit{region of interest} (RoI). L1 has a latency time of 2.5 $\mu$s; this corresponds to about 100 collisions, whose information has to be temporarily stored in buffers before the L1 central trigger processor (CTP) finalizes a decision based on the inputs from the L1 calorimeter trigger (L1Calo), L1 muon trigger (L1Muon) and the topological trigger (L1Topo). 

During Run1 the HLT consisted of two separate steps, that in Run2 have been merged to have a simpler setup and better resource sharing. The HLT uses information with finer granularity from the calorimeter systems, precision tracking from the muon spectrometer and tracking information from the ID, not available for L1. The HLT reduces further the event rate to about 1 kHz, and has a processing time of about 0.2 s per each event. 

A trigger chain is a set of selections that characterize a certain trigger object, and the list of all available trigger chains defines the \textit{trigger menu}; some of the items on the menu are unprescaled, which means all the events firing that trigger are stored, while others are associated to a prescale constant P such that only a fraction $\frac{1}{P}$ of the events firing the trigger are stored.

\subsection{ATLAS Operation}

ATLAS has been successfully recording the collision data delivered by the LHC in Run1 and Run2. Figure \ref{fig:atlas:lumi1} shows the cumulative luminosity delivered by the LHC between the declaration of stable beams and the request to put the detector in standby for beam dump (green area in the figure) and the luminosity recorded by ATLAS (yellow) in 2015 and 2016, which is the dataset used in the analyses described in this thesis. The difference between the two derives from inefficiencies of the data acquisition system and from the "warm start" procedure: the high voltage of the tracking devices and the preamplifiers of the pixel detector are turned on after the start of stable beams \cite{LumiTwiki}.

At the time of this writing, the 2017 dataset has been collected but not yet analyzed. The delivered and collected luminosity for 2017 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:atlas:lumi1}(c). Not all the collected luminosity can be used for physics analyses, as most of these require a good state of all the detector subsystems. This is checked for each luminosity block; the ones with poor detector conditions are disregarded, while the ones that pass this criteria form the \textit{good run list} (GRL). Figure \ref{fig:atlas:lumi1}(d) shows the total cumulative luminosity for the 2015-2017 period, highlighting the portion that enters the GRL (blue).
