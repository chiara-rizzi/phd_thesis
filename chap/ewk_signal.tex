\section{Signal Model}

This analysis studies the simplified model shown in Figure \ref{fig:feyn}, targeting primarily the decays via Higgs boson.

	\caption{Diagram for the simplified model considered in the analysis. The primary interpretation of the analysis is the decay via Higgs bosons, but decays via varied branching ratios to $Z$ bosons are also studied. The production of the \hino\ occurs
via mass-degenerate pairs of charginos or neutralinos, which decay to the \ninoone\ and immeasurably low momentum particles.}
