abstract="We describe likelihood-based statistical tests for use in high energy physics for the discovery of new phenomena and for construction of confidence intervals on model parameters. We focus on the properties of the test procedures that allow one to account for systematic uncertainties. Explicit formulae for the asymptotic distributions of test statistics are derived using results of Wilks and Wald. We motivate and justify the use of a representative data set, called the ``Asimov data set'', which provides a simple method to obtain the median experimental sensitivity of a search or measurement as well as fluctuations about this expectation.",

abstract="The earliest method of estimation of statistical parameters is the method of least squares due to Mark off. A set of observations whose expectations are linear functions of a number of unknown parameters being given, the problem which Markoff posed for solution is to find out a linear function of observations whose expectation is an assigned linear function of the unknown parameters and whose variance is a minimum. There is no assumption about the distribution of the observations except that each has a finite variance.",
